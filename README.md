# 🏈 NFL QB Rating Predictor (2023)

This project uses 2023 NFL quarterback statistics to predict **passer rating** using a linear regression model in Python.

---

## 📚 Project Summary

We scrape official data from [Pro-Football-Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing.htm) and build a model that predicts quarterback passer ratings using:

- Touchdowns (TD)
- Interceptions (INT)
- Passing Yards
- Completion Percentage
- Yards per Attempt
- Sack Percentage
- Games & Attempts

The goal: demonstrate how sports performance data can be used to build accurate machine learning models.

## 📊 Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn (LinearRegression)

## 🧠 Model Performance

| Metric         | Score      |
|----------------|------------|
| **R² Score**   | ~0.93      |
| **MSE**        | ~7.2       |

The model performs very well, predicting passer ratings with high accuracy.
